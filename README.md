=========

Inspired by [MailCatcher](http://mailcatcher.me/), easier to install.

* Download and run MailHog
* Configure your outgoing SMTP server
* View your outgoing email in a web UI
* Release it to a real mail server

Built with Go - MailHog runs without installation on multiple platforms.

### Overview

MailHog is an email testing tool for developers:

* Configure your application to use MailHog for SMTP delivery
* View messages in the web UI, or retrieve them with the JSON API
* Optionally release messages to real SMTP servers for delivery

### Installation

#### Manual installation
[Download the latest release for your platform](/docs/RELEASES.md). Then
[read the deployment guide](/docs/DEPLOY.md) for deployment options.

#### MacOS
```bash
brew update && brew install mailhog
```

Then, start MailHog by running `mailhog` in the command line.

#### Debian / Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt-get -y install golang-go
go get github.com/mailhog/MailHog
```

Then, start MailHog by running `/path/to/MailHog` in the command line.

E.g. the path to Go's bin files on Ubuntu is `~/go/bin/`, so to start the MailHog run:

```bash
~/go/bin/MailHog
```

#### FreeBSD
```bash
pkg install mailhog
sysrc mailhog_enable="YES"
service mailhog start
```

#### Docker
[Run it from Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/mailhog/mailhog/) or using the provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)

Check out how to [configure MailHog](/docs/CONFIG.md), or use the default settings:
  * the SMTP server starts on port 1025
  * the HTTP server starts on port 8025

#### sendmail

[mhsendmail](https://github.com/mailhog/mhsendmail) is a sendmail replacement for MailHog.

It redirects mail to MailHog using SMTP.

You can also use `MailHog sendmail ...` instead of the separate mhsendmail binary.

Alternatively, you can use your native `sendmail` command by providing `-S`, for example:

```bash
/usr/sbin/sendmail -S mail:1025
```

For example, in PHP you could add either of these lines to `php.ini`:

```
sendmail_path = /usr/local/bin/mhsendmail
sendmail_path = /usr/sbin/sendmail -S mail:1025
```
